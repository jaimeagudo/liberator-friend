# liberator-friend

It includes an extra Friend workflow to deal with JSON content on the request body based on Sam's previous [works](https://gist.github.com/sritchie/7552129) as well. Thanks from here Sam!

It also includes awesome Datomic DB, thanks to http://aan.io/datomic-n00biness/

Example code for Sam's [blog post](http://sritchie.github.io/2014/01/17/api-authentication-with-liberator-and-friend/) on using [Liberator](https://github.com/clojure-liberator/liberator) and [Friend](https://github.com/cemerick/friend) to write RESTful APIs with a great authentication and authorization story.
